# Reproducing Results for "Bivalent Impact of Social Networks on the Overarming Dilemma"

This repository contains the codes and data necessary to reproduce the results and figures presented in the paper "Bivalent Impact of Social Networks on the Overarming Dilemma: Insights to Align Social and Individual Interests" by Feng Fu, Michael Herron, and Dan Rockmore from Dartmouth College.

## Overview

This project includes a Mathematica Notebook and C++ codes, which are used to simulate and analyze the impact of social networks on gun adoption rates. The repository is organized into different sections for ease of navigation and use.

## Contents

### Mathematica Notebook for Figures

- **Location**: `gitResults.nb`
- **Description**: This Mathematica Notebook can be used to reproduce main Figures 1-4 and supplementary Figures S1-S5.
- **Usage Note**: The notebook utilizes compiled simulation data located in the `/mathematica` directory.

### C++ Codes for Simulating Gun Adoption Rates

- **Location**: `/realnetworksimulations`
- **Details**: To reproduce the simulation results related to gun adoption rates on real social networks, refer to the detailed `readme.md` in this directory.
- **Additional Information**: This folder also contains the real social network data files used in the simulations.

### Real Social Network Data Files

- **Location**: `/realnetworksimulations/gangnetworkdata`
- **Description**: This directory includes the anonymized, coded social network data files used in our simulations.
- **Sources and Credits**: For information about the source and credits of these publicly available data files, please refer to the `readme.md` file in the same directory.

## Instructions

1. **For Mathematica Notebook**:
   - Navigate to `gitResults.nb`.
   - Open and run the Mathematica Notebook to generate the figures.

2. **For C++ Simulations**:
   - Go to the `/realnetworksimulations` folder.
   - Follow the instructions in the `readme.md` to set up and run the simulations.

## Additional Resources

- For any further information or clarification, please refer to the respective `readme.md` files in each directory or contact the authors of the paper.
