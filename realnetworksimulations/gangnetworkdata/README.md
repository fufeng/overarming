# Gang Network Data for Simulations of Gun Adoption Rates

This `README.md` provides information about the three real gang network datasets used in our simulations of gun adoption rates. These datasets are formatted specifically for import into C++ codes.

## Dataset Overview

### 1. Montreal Street Gang Network Data

- **Source**: [CASOS Datasets](http://www.casos.cs.cmu.edu/tools/datasets/external/index.php)
- **Original Credit**: Karine Descormiers and Carlo Morselli (2011)
- **Publication**: "Alliances, Conflicts, and Contradictions in Montreal's Street Gang Landscape", International Criminal Justice Review, Vol. 1 No. 3, pp. 297-314.
- **Details**: This dataset represents the social network of street gangs in Montreal, Canada.

### 2. London Gang Network Data

- **Source**: [CASOS Datasets](http://www.casos.cs.cmu.edu/tools/datasets/external/index.php)
- **Original Credit**: Grund, T. and Densley, J. (2015)
- **Publication**: "Ethnic Homophily and Triad Closure: Mapping Internal Gang Structure Using Exponential Random Graph Models", Journal of Contemporary Criminal Justice, Vol. 31, Issue 3, pp. 354-370.
- **Details**: This dataset provides insights into the network structure of gangs in London, UK.

### 3. Italian Co-Membership of Gangs

- **Source**: [CASOS Datasets](http://www.casos.cs.cmu.edu/tools/datasets/external/index.php)
- **Original Source**: The Italian gang network data is part of the **COVERT Networks** datasets, compiled by the Mitchell Centre for Social Network Analysis ([Project website](https://www.socialsciences.manchester.ac.uk/mitchell-centre/research/covert-networks/)) at the  University of Manchester and funded by a grant from the Leverhulme Trust (RPG-2013-140). These [covert networks datasets](https://sites.google.com/site/ucinetsoftware/datasets/covert-networks) are originally distributed for public use by the Social Network Analysis software UCINET, which is available for download at: https://sites.google.com/site/ucinetsoftware/datasets/covert-networks/italian-gangs
- **UCINET Credit**: Borgatti, S.P., Everett, M.G. and Freeman, L.C. (2002)
- **Publication**: "Ucinet for Windows: Software for Social Network Analysis", Harvard, MA: Analytic Technologies.
- **Details**: The dataset includes co-membership information of Italian gangs.

## Usage Instructions

- Ensure that these datasets are downloaded and formatted as per the requirements of the C++ codes used for simulation.
- For more details on data format and simulation instructions, refer to the specific documentation of the C++ simulation codes.
