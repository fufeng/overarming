# Real Social Network Data for Simulations of Gun Adoption Decisions

This `README.md` provides information about the three real network datasets used in our simulations of gun adoption rates. These datasets are formatted specifically for import into C++ codes.

## Dataset Overview

### 1. Gang Network Data

- **Publication**: "Alliances, Conflicts, and Contradictions in Montreal's Street Gang Landscape", International Criminal Justice Review, Vol. 1 No. 3, pp. 297-314.
- **Details**: This dataset represents the social network of street gangs in Montreal, Canada.

### 2. Village Network Data

- **Publication**:  "Social network targeting to maximise population behaviour change: a cluster randomised controlled trial." The Lancet 386, no. 9989 (2015): 145-153.
- **Details**: This dataset provides insights into the network structure of village populations from Honduras.

### 3. Campus Network Data

- **Original Credit**: Christakis, Nicholas A., and James H. Fowler (2010)
- **Publication**: "Social network sensors for early detection of contagious outbreaks." PloS one 5.9 (2010): e12948.
- **Details**: This dataset provides insights into the network structure of college students from the United States.

## Usage Instructions

- Ensure that these datasets are downloaded and formatted as per the requirements of the C++ codes used for simulation.
- For more details on data format and simulation instructions, refer to the specific documentation of the C++ simulation codes.
