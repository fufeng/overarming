# Running Simulations on Real Social Networks

This guide provides detailed steps to run simulations on real social networks using the provided C++ codes.

## Prerequisites

- Ensure you have `g++` compiler installed on your system to compile C++ code.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Prepare the Network Data File
1. Locate the real network data files provided.
2. Copy and paste your chosen data file into the same directory as the C++ code files.
3. Rename the file to `graph00.txt`.

### Step 2: Set Simulation Parameters
1. Open the `networkgames.cpp` file in a text editor.
2. Modify the simulation parameters as needed within this file.

### Step 3: Compile and Execute the Code
1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the `networkgames.cpp` file.
3. Compile the code using the following command: 
g++ -o networkgames networkgames.cpp
4. Execute the compiled program:
./networkgames

### Step 4: Access Simulation Data
- After running the simulation, all output data will be saved in plain text files within the same directory.
